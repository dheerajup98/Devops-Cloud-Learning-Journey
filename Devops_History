## 1️⃣ History of DevOps (how it all started)

🕰 Before DevOps (around 2000–2008)
Software companies worked in silos:

Developers
→ wrote code
→ “my code works on my machine”

Operations / SysAdmins
→ managed servers, deployments, uptime
→ “don’t touch production”

## 🚨 The problem

Deployments took weeks or months
Too many handoffs
Production failures

## 📌 The term “DevOps”
Coined around 2009
From Dev + Ops

Agile movement
Continuous Delivery
Cloud computing
