# 🚀 What is SDLC?

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a structured process used to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software systems.

It defines:

- How software is built  
- Who works on each stage  
- How quality is maintained  
- How risk is minimized  
- How software moves to production  

SDLC ensures **systematic, reliable, and scalable software delivery**.

# 🔄 Phases of SDLC

## 1️⃣ Requirement Gathering
Understanding business needs and technical feasibility.

## 2️⃣ Planning
Project estimation, resource allocation, timeline planning, and risk assessment.

## 3️⃣ Design
System architecture, database design, infrastructure design, and technical blueprint.

## 4️⃣ Development
Writing code, version control (Git), collaboration, and code reviews.

## 5️⃣ Testing
- Unit testing  
- Integration testing  
- Performance testing  
- Security testing  

## 6️⃣ Deployment
Releasing the application to staging or production environments.

## 7️⃣ Maintenance & Monitoring
- Bug fixes  
- Performance optimization  
- Scaling  
- Logging  
- Monitoring

# 🎯 Why Do We Need SDLC?

SDLC provides:

- Structured development process  
- Better quality control  
- Risk reduction  
- Cost optimization  
- Improved collaboration  
- Predictable delivery timelines  

### ❌ Without SDLC:
- Releases become chaotic  
- Production failures increase  
- Teams work in silos  
- Deployment risks grow  

---

# 🔥 Why SDLC is Important in DevOps?

DevOps is not just tools like **Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, or Terraform**.

DevOps is about optimizing the entire **Software Development Life Cycle**.

A DevOps Engineer must understand:

- How software flows from development to production  
- Where automation is required  
- Where bottlenecks occur  
- How to reduce deployment failures  

Without SDLC knowledge, DevOps becomes only tool execution — not engineering thinking.

# ⚙️ DevOps Involvement in Each SDLC Phase

## 🔹 Requirement & Planning
- Cloud feasibility analysis  
- Cost estimation (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- Infrastructure capacity planning  

## 🔹 Design
- Infrastructure architecture design  
- CI/CD pipeline design  
- Security integration strategy  
- Containerization planning  

## 🔹 Development
- Git workflow strategy  
- Branching models (GitFlow, Trunk-based)  
- Continuous Integration setup  

## 🔹 Testing
- Automated testing pipelines  
- Security scanning  
- Static code analysis  
- Performance validation  

## 🔹 Deployment
- CI/CD implementation  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
- Docker & Kubernetes deployment  
- Blue-Green / Canary releases  

## 🔹 Maintenance & Monitoring
- Observability (Prometheus, Grafana)  
- Logging systems  
- Auto-scaling  
- Incident response  
- Reliability engineering

## 🔄 DevOps Makes SDLC Continuous

- Continuous Integration  
- Continuous Testing  
- Continuous Deployment  
- Continuous Monitoring

# 📌 What is Agile Methodology?

**Agile** is an iterative software development approach where software is built in small increments called **Sprints (2–4 weeks)**.

Instead of delivering software after months, Agile delivers working features frequently.

Agile focuses on:

- Customer collaboration  
- Continuous feedback  
- Adaptive planning  
- Rapid delivery  

---

# 🔁 Agile Process Overview

1. Product Backlog creation  
2. Sprint Planning  
3. Development  
4. Daily Standup  
5. Testing within sprint  
6. Sprint Review  
7. Retrospective  

This cycle repeats continuously.

# 🚀 Why Agile is Important for DevOps Engineers?

Agile and DevOps complement each other.

### ✅ Agile Enables:
- Frequent code changes  
- Incremental releases  
- Continuous feedback  

### ✅ DevOps Enables:
- Continuous Integration (CI)  
- Continuous Delivery (CD)  
- Automated testing  
- Infrastructure automation  
- Production monitoring  

Together they create:
