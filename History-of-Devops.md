# 🔹 What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a culture, practice, and automation-driven approach that integrates **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** teams to improve collaboration, speed, reliability, and software delivery efficiency.

DevOps focuses on:

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Automation
- Monitoring & Observability
- Collaboration & Shared Responsibility

DevOps aims to deliver software:

- Faster
- More reliably
- With fewer failures
- With automated workflows

# 📜 History & Evolution of DevOps

## 🔹 Before DevOps (Pre-2008 Era)

Around 10–15 years ago, software development and IT operations worked in completely separate silos.

### Development Team:
- Wrote application code
- Focused on features
- Goal: Deliver new functionality

### Operations / System Admin Team:
- Managed servers
- Deployed applications manually
- Maintained uptime and infrastructure
- Goal: Keep production stable

### Build & Release Engineers:
- Managed build processes
- Created deployment packages
- Coordinated between dev and ops
- Often manually executed deployment steps

# ⚠️ Problems Before DevOps

## 1️⃣ Manual Deployments
- Applications deployed manually on physical servers
- High chances of configuration errors
- No version-controlled infrastructure

## 2️⃣ Long Release Cycles
- Releases happened every 3–6 months
- Huge deployment windows
- High production risk

## 3️⃣ “Works on My Machine” Problem
- Developers tested locally
- Production environments were different
- Environment mismatch caused failures

## 4️⃣ Blame Culture
- Dev blamed Ops
- Ops blamed Dev
- Build engineers stuck in between

## 5️⃣ Scaling Challenges
- Manual server provisioning
- Slow infrastructure setup
- No cloud automation

This model could not scale with fast-growing internet products like Amazon, Netflix, and Google.

# 🔥 The Pain of Build & Release Engineers (Before DevOps)

Build & Release Engineers faced major challenges:

- Manual build creation
- Dependency conflicts
- Deployment script failures
- Late-night production releases
- No automated rollback strategy
- High pressure during production outages

They acted as the bridge but lacked automation tools like:

- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform

---

# 🖥️ The Pain of Server Admins & System Admins

System and Server Administrators faced:

- Manual server configuration
- Physical hardware dependency
- Slow provisioning (days/weeks)
- Patch management complexity
- Limited monitoring tools
- Reactive troubleshooting

Infrastructure was managed manually, not as code.

# 🚀 Birth of DevOps

Around 2008–2009, the industry realized:

To deliver faster and more reliable software, development and operations must collaborate.

DevOps emerged with:

- Automation
- Shared responsibility
- CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud computing
- Infrastructure as Code
- Containerization (Docker)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
